Hello! Im really still just a beginner in web development and I've decided to learn web dev in The Odin Project. 

The main purpose of this project is to practice my flexbox skills and try to make my very first webpage, albeit a bit messy a noob-ish.

Well, here goes my attempt!

Project Start: January 11, 2023
Project end: TBA

Progress Report: 01/11/2023 11:42PM
have partially finished the hero text portion of the webpage. Will determine if sufficient and will implement further changes when deemed insufficient.
